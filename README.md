HighCloud Airlines Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing airline operations data to uncover key insights into passenger trends, flight performance, and route efficiency. Using SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, the data is processed and visualized to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

Key Highlights:
Data Extraction & Transformation: SQL queries are used to retrieve and clean airline data.

Excel Analysis: Pivot tables and charts provide a preliminary data overview.

Power BI Dashboard: Interactive visualizations track key metrics such as passenger volume, load factor, and top-performing routes.

Tableau Insights: Additional deep-dive visualizations for trend analysis and route performance evaluation.

Insights Derived:
Weekdays show a higher passenger load factor (~71%) compared to weekends (~29%).

The busiest airlines include Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and US Airways.

The most traveled routes are Chicago-Atlanta and Washington-New York based on passenger volume.

This project demonstrates data-driven decision-making in the airline industry, showcasing expertise in data analytics and visualization tools. ðŸš€
